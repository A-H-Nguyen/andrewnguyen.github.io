    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm originally from a small town called Braintree Massachusetts.
        After graduating from the local high school, I enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Lowell as an electrical engineer.
        However, it wasn't for me, so I decided to transfer to Northeastern University in Boston.
        This ended up being one of the best decisions I've made.
        At Northeastern I had way more opportunities through both the co-op program, and finding professors to do research with.
        Here, I ended up changing majors slightly.
        I went from pure electrical engineering to dual majoring in electrical engineering and physics, and then eventually dropping the double major for a combined electrical and computer engineering program.
        In hindsight, I do wish I had stuck more with physics, as the only reason I really dropped it was that I was intimidated by quantum mechanics.

        Being intimidated is fine, but I've since learned that growth only happens when pushing through things that are scary or difficult.

        Becoming an electrical and computer engineer was by now means a bad or wrong choice, as during my time as an undergrad I was able to do research with the Northeastern University Computer Architecture Lab under Dr. David Kaeli, and even landed a co-op position at AMD.
        Both are things that I would not have been able to do if not for the world of computer engineering exposing me to the joys (terrors) of digital design, and low level software!
