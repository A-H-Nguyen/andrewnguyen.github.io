My personal website.

Hopefully I can make this look at least passable.
Feel free to copy this code. I already liberally stole code from my good friend [Michael Shen](https://michaeltshen.github.io/index.html).

All the colors I've used are purloined from the popular [catpuccin color scheme](https://catppuccin.com/palette).
Mocha is my personal favorite, but I decided to spice things up for myself by sticking with frappe.
