## About Me
I'm currently a PhD Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.
My main research interests are in the realm of computer architecture, high performance computing, and compilers.
Mainly compilers, because they're my favorite.

## WIP
I really don't want to learn CSS or html, but look at this website...
