        <p>
            Hi, I'm Andrew
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a PhD Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.
            My main research interests are computer architecture, high performance computing, and compilers.
            Mainly compilers, because they're my favorite.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's an important distinction that I am a Computer Engineer, and NOT a Computer Scientist.
            This is for two reasons.
            One, is because it's fun to annoy people with pedantry.
            Two, is because if I was actually in CS, this website might look good.
